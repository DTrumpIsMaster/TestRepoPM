Create a new visual studio console application Project.

Write a program that does the following, in comments next to the line write the value of the changed variable

//delcare a double called myDouble and initialize it to 123.3245
//declare an integer called myInt and initialize it to 12
//declare a float called myFloat and initialize it to 19.6
//add myInt to .6 and put the result into myDouble
//convert myFloat to an interger and put it into myInt  
//(when you debug check to see if it rounded to nearest or down)
//convert myDouble to an integer and put into myInt (make it round opposite way as last line)
//divide myInt by 3 and put the result into myDouble;
//set myDouble to be 12.6
//set myFloat to be 13.8
//add myDouble to myFloat and put the result into myInt; (result should be 26)
//add myDouble to myFloat and put the result into myInt; (result should be 27- change when you do conversion to integers)
