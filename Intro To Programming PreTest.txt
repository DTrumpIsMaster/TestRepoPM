8. Write a program that does the following (15 pts You can do this in Visual Studio or Eclipse and copy paste into moodle):
//declare and initialize a variable named var1 to the integer 6
//declare and initialize a variable named var2 to the string "Frank"
//Print out the value of var1 and var2 on 2 separate lines
//add 5 to the value of var1 and put it back into var1
//multiply var1 by two and put the result into a new variable named var3
//divide var1 by 2 and put the result into a new variable var4,
//print the value of var4, make sure that it is 5.5 not 5. (fix the above line if it is not 5.5)
//cast var3 to a string and store it into a new variable named var5
//combine var2 and var5 and put it into var2 (should say Frank22)
//print "var2 holds: " along with the value of var2 on one line.
//ask the user to input a number and store the input into var6
//print var6 to the screen


9. Fix the errors in the code below(5pts):

int myDecimal = 15.1;
int myInteger = 10;
    myString = "frank";
int myOtherInt;
myOtherInt = myInteger / 2 //initialize myOtherInt to half of myInteger
myOther1nt = myOtherInt +1; //add 1 to myOtherInt
5 + myInteger = myInteger; //add five to myInteger
